# Welcome to Postcardium!

### About

Inspired by PostSecret, a true guilty pleasure of my highschool days, I started working on this project to practice using cloud storage and the GoogleMaps API in my applications. The idea is you can upload a photo, write a postcard-length message, and "post" it anonymously.

### Currently Working on:

- Setting up the backend routes for uploading and retrieving photos

### Ideas for the future:

Things I would like to implement:

- pull location from the files
- add search functionality
- find a way to make sure the photos are of scenary/landscape and not people.
